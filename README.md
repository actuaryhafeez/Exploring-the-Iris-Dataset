# Exploring the Iris Dataset: A Classic Example of Supervised Learning and Data Visualization
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset consists of 150 observations, with 50 observations for each species.

The Iris dataset is often used as a classic example of supervised learning, as the goal is to predict the species of the flower based on its measurements. It is also used for data visualization and clustering.

The Iris dataset is available in many machine learning libraries and can be easily accessed through Python or R. It is a well-studied dataset and is often used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of new algorithms.
